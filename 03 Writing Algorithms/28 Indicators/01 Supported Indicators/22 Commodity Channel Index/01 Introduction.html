<p>This indicator represents the traditional commodity channel index (CCI) CCI = (Typical Price - 20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 * Mean Deviation) Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3 Constant = 0.015 There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation, first, subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price. Second, take the absolute values of these numbers. Third, sum the absolute values. Fourth, divide by the total number of periods (20).</p>
