<p>In technical analysis Beta indicator is used to measure volatility or risk of a target (ETF) relative to the overall risk (volatility) of the reference (market indexes). The Beta indicators compares target's price movement to the movements of the indexes over the same period of time. It is common practice to use the SPX index as a benchmark of the overall reference market when it comes to Beta calculations.</p>
